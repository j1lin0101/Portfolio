          <h3>Hello Everyone!</h3>
          <p>As a UX Designer, I realize that I am in a position of influence where I can be an <<strong>advocate</strong> for user groups that normally do not have a platform to speak.</p>
          <p>I strive to be the voice for these people so that their needs as a <em>unique and special group</em> are acknowledged and met.</p>
          <p>I hope to be not only be a great designer, but I also hope that I can be a <strong>great leader</strong> who sets an example of what it means to design with compassion and empathy in the tech sphere.</p>
